Howdy, world. My name is Bryson Miller, and this is my personal website. Here I will be discussing topics in the fields of programming, music, and health. 

Since I just graduated from college, I have a lot more free time now. I also have lot of thoughtsâ„¢. This blog will mainly serve as a one-off dumping ground for any interesting problems/solutions or ideas that I've come across while going about my day job or hobby projects.

Outside of code, I would like to write a bit about music I'm listening to or drumming exercises I am practicing. I also want to try to post some of my workout plans that I've cooked up since hopping off of the Jeff Nippard ones I started with.

I will also have a Youtube channel where I stream and upload programming related content. It will be more didactic in nature, whereas this blog is largely just a stream of consciousness.

Hope you all enjoy!

Bryson
