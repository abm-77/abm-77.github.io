# A Little Background

Since coming home from school, I've had a lot more time to practice the drums (yay)! For context, I've been playing the drum set since 7th grade. I started off learning West African drumming, the steel pans
and even traditional Japanese taiko drumming. In high school, I played in Jazz Band, Gospel Band, Symphonic Band, and even the marching band as a snare drummer. I thought I would not play in college, but I was convinced by a friend of mine to audition for an on-campus, R&B/Jass/Hip-Hop group called "Love, and a Sandwich." Despite drumming in this group, I only really got to practice the drums twice per week during our scheduled rehearsal times. Therefore, I was mostly just learning the music, but didn't really feel myself progressing to much skills-wise. So when I got home, I was excited about my newfound free time to really hone in on some stuff I've been wanting to work on.

For additional context, I'm very much into Jazz, Hip-Hop, and R&B drumming (who would've guessed). I'm also into rock (math rock, prog rock, you name it), Afro-Cuban, and Soca/Calyspo. Although I am very interested in jazz drumming, it is honestly my weakest area. I very much struggle with comping and soloing in jazz styles. I also wanted to improve my linear mobility around the kit and overall chops. With this in mind, I devised a little daily practice routine that I found worked for me.

# Warm-up

After spending about 2 years only really focusing on learning music and not technique, I noticed my hands were much weaker than they had been when I was in marching band. This was unacceptable for a former center snare! Thus, I broke out some of my old warmups from my drumline days. Specifically, [Tommy Igoe's Lifetime Warmup](https://0.academia-photos.com/attachment_thumbnails/36407054/mini_magick20180817-8210-140arh1.png?1534562483). I would do the [intermediate version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJfhQNloRuU) one-time through to get my hands ready for playing.

Next I borrowed some kit warmups from Mark Guilliana's ["Exploring Your Creativity On the Drumset"](https://hudsonmusic.com/product/exploring-your-creativity-on-the-drumset/) and Mark Colenburg's ["The Beat Matrix Unlocked."](https://hudsonmusic.com/product/the-beat-matrix-unlocked/) These consited of starting with a basic four-on-the-floor beat, and displacing the kick by a 16th-note each go around. Then, I would do some fills that focused on the metric modulation ideas explored in Guilliana's book.

# The Good stuff

The bulk of the practice was spent working out of two books, ["The Art of Bop Drumming,"](https://www.alfred.com/the-art-of-bop-drumming/p/00-MMBK0056CD/) by John Riley, and ["Linear Drumming,"](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Drumming-Mike-Johnston/dp/0557265894) by Mike Johnston. I had worked out of these books a bit while I was still taking drum lessons, and figured they'd be a good return to my structured practice. Each day, I would learn 2 new fill patterns out of "Linear Drumming," starting from the beginning of the book. I would warmup with the previous day's patterns and try to speed them up as well. If you're familiar with the book, you first start learning the pattern on the snare, then the snare and hi-hat, then the snare and floor tom, then the snare and floor tom again, this time with your left foot playing the hi-hat on each quarter-note. I added another variant: playing the pattern around the kit while keeping the quarter-note pulse with your left foot. While learning a new pattern, I would start off in the 60-80 BPM range depending on how hard the pattern was for me to learn. I would slowly bump this up to a steady 120-130 BPM. The subsequent day when I revisted the pattern, I would try to get it up to 150 BPM before going into the new patterns for that day.

The approach I took for "The Art of Bop Drumming" was a bit more straight-forward. I just started with a page of comping patterns and tried to learn half of them each day. Luckily, I had the ride pattern down fairly well, so it really just came down to the interplay of my right and left hands. I took John Riley's advice in the foresections of the book to feather the bass drum on each quarter note while keeping the swing pattern and comping ideas flowing up top. In a given session, I would start at the first pattern, play it ten times perfectly, then move on to the next pattern. If I messed up, I would start the pattern again. I repeated this until I finished the days session. I started off at around 100 BPM and tried to work up to about 140-150 BPM before I called it a day.

# Goofing Around

I would always finish a session with working on a new song or trying some trancription I saw on Instagram. Some songs I've been playing along to are:

- [Pig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkUR_GdCy4) - This Town Needs Guns
- [Mistress Luck- A Portrait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSR1imtmDDU) - Chick Corea Elektric Band
- [Born For This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFxpEFb7TtE) - Paramore
- [Jazz Crimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI87MSwRZS0) - Joshua Redman
- [Change (In the House of Flies)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPpDyIJdasg) - Deftones
- [Boogielastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxDNvKVgeiY) - Joshua Redman
- [Klink Remix (Live)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITP0C-eytBQ) and [Klink Remix (Recording)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCYmxNoSSPY) - Smino, T-Pain
- [I Hate Everything About You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqbQuypKCCU) - Three Days Grace

# Conclusion

That's all for this write-up. Hopefully there's some things you can take from this and incorporate in your practicing! Happy playing!
