      <description>Background Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty into debuggers. With the recent development of the RAD Debugger Project, RemedyBG&amp;rsquo;s continued existence, and smaller projects like Spray, I became interested in how they work under the hood. So I set out to try to craft a (simple) debugger on my own. Unfortunately, I decided to start at the harder part of crafting a debugger, parsing ELF and DWARF. Ok, to be fair, they are not ESPECIALLY difficult, but there is a severe lack of resources available on the subject (please correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong here).</description>
