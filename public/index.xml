      <description>Background Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty into debuggers. With the recent development of the RAD Debugger Project, RemedyBG&amp;rsquo;s continued existence, and smaller projects like Spray, I became interested in how they work under the hood. So I set out to try to craft a (simple) debugger on my own. Unfortunately, I decided to start at the harder part of crafting a debugger, parsing ELF and DWARF. Ok, to be fair, they are not ESPECIALLY difficult, but there is a severe lack of resources available on the subject (please correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong here).</description>

      <description>Howdy, world. My name is Bryson Miller, and this is my personal website. Here I will be discussing topics in the fields of programming, music, and health.&#xA;Since I just graduated from college, I have a lot more free time now. I also have lot of thoughtsâ„¢. This blog will mainly serve as a one-off dumping ground for any interesting problems/solutions or ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across while going about my day job or hobby projects.</description>
