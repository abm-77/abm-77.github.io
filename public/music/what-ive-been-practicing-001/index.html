  <h1>What Ive Been Practicing - 001</h1>
  <div class="blog-post-content">
    <h1 id="a-little-background">A Little Background</h1>
<p>Since coming home from school, I&rsquo;ve had a lot more time to practice the drums (yay)! For context, I&rsquo;ve been playing the drum set since 7th grade. I started off learning West African drumming, the steel pans
and even traditional Japanese taiko drumming. In high school, I played in Jazz Band, Gospel Band, Symphonic Band, and even the marching band as a snare drummer. I thought I would not play in college, but I was convinced by a friend of mine to audition for an on-campus, R&amp;B/Jass/Hip-Hop group called &ldquo;Love, and a Sandwich.&rdquo; Despite drumming in this group, I only really got to practice the drums twice per week during our scheduled rehearsal times. Therefore, I was mostly just learning the music, but didn&rsquo;t really feel myself progressing to much skills-wise. So when I got home, I was excited about my newfound free time to really hone in on some stuff I&rsquo;ve been wanting to work on.</p>
<p>For additional context, I&rsquo;m very much into Jazz, Hip-Hop, and R&amp;B drumming (who would&rsquo;ve guessed). I&rsquo;m also into rock (math rock, prog rock, you name it), Afro-Cuban, and Soca/Calyspo. Although I am very interested in jazz drumming, it is honestly my weakest area. I very much struggle with comping and soloing in jazz styles. I also wanted to improve my linear mobility around the kit and overall chops. With this in mind, I devised a little daily practice routine that I found worked for me.</p>
<h1 id="warm-up">Warm-up</h1>
<p>After spending about 2 years only really focusing on learning music and not technique, I noticed my hands were much weaker than they had been when I was in marching band. This was unacceptable for a former center snare! Thus, I broke out some of my old warmups from my drumline days. Specifically, <a href="https://0.academia-photos.com/attachment_thumbnails/36407054/mini_magick20180817-8210-140arh1.png?1534562483">Tommy Igoe&rsquo;s Lifetime Warmup</a>. I would do the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJfhQNloRuU">intermediate version</a> one-time through to get my hands ready for playing.</p>
<p>Next I borrowed some kit warmups from Mark Guilliana&rsquo;s <a href="https://hudsonmusic.com/product/exploring-your-creativity-on-the-drumset/">&ldquo;Exploring Your Creativity On the Drumset&rdquo;</a> and Mark Colenburg&rsquo;s <a href="https://hudsonmusic.com/product/the-beat-matrix-unlocked/">&ldquo;The Beat Matrix Unlocked.&rdquo;</a> These consited of starting with a basic four-on-the-floor beat, and displacing the kick by a 16th-note each go around. Then, I would do some fills that focused on the metric modulation ideas explored in Guilliana&rsquo;s book.</p>
<h1 id="the-good-stuff">The Good stuff</h1>
<p>The bulk of the practice was spent working out of two books, <a href="https://www.alfred.com/the-art-of-bop-drumming/p/00-MMBK0056CD/">&ldquo;The Art of Bop Drumming,&rdquo;</a> by John Riley, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Drumming-Mike-Johnston/dp/0557265894">&ldquo;Linear Drumming,&rdquo;</a> by Mike Johnston. I had worked out of these books a bit while I was still taking drum lessons, and figured they&rsquo;d be a good return to my structured practice. Each day, I would learn 2 new fill patterns out of &ldquo;Linear Drumming,&rdquo; starting from the beginning of the book. I would warmup with the previous day&rsquo;s patterns and try to speed them up as well. If you&rsquo;re familiar with the book, you first start learning the pattern on the snare, then the snare and hi-hat, then the snare and floor tom, then the snare and floor tom again, this time with your left foot playing the hi-hat on each quarter-note. I added another variant: playing the pattern around the kit while keeping the quarter-note pulse with your left foot. While learning a new pattern, I would start off in the 60-80 BPM range depending on how hard the pattern was for me to learn. I would slowly bump this up to a steady 120-130 BPM. The subsequent day when I revisted the pattern, I would try to get it up to 150 BPM before going into the new patterns for that day.</p>
<p>The approach I took for &ldquo;The Art of Bop Drumming&rdquo; was a bit more straight-forward. I just started with a page of comping patterns and tried to learn half of them each day. Luckily, I had the ride pattern down fairly well, so it really just came down to the interplay of my right and left hands. I took John Riley&rsquo;s advice in the foresections of the book to feather the bass drum on each quarter note while keeping the swing pattern and comping ideas flowing up top. In a given session, I would start at the first pattern, play it ten times perfectly, then move on to the next pattern. If I messed up, I would start the pattern again. I repeated this until I finished the days session. I started off at around 100 BPM and tried to work up to about 140-150 BPM before I called it a day.</p>
<h1 id="goofing-around">Goofing Around</h1>
<p>I would always finish a session with working on a new song or trying some trancription I saw on Instagram. Some songs I&rsquo;ve been playing along to are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkUR_GdCy4">Pig</a> - This Town Needs Guns</li>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for this write-up. Hopefully there&rsquo;s some things you can take from this and incorporate in your practicing! Happy playing!</p>
